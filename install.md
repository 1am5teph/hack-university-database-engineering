#Setup your system

We will use Vagrant and Virtual Box so all of our systems will behave identically.

#### [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 

Virtual Box allows you to run a small linux computer within your laptop!  Find the right package for your OS and install it:

- [Ubuntu 15.03](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.14/virtualbox-5.0_5.0.14-105127~Ubuntu~wily_amd64.deb)
- [any Linux](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)
- [OSX](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.14/VirtualBox-5.0.14-105127-OSX.dmg)
- [Win64](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.14/VirtualBox-5.0.14-105127-Win.exe)

#### [Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Vagrant is a system that allows you to automate a lot of the process involved in configuring and controlling virtual machines on your laptop. 

Go to the Vagrant [download page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to find the installation package for your OS. Download the package and double click it to open it with your package manager (software installer). On Ubuntu, the "Software Center" will launch and you click either the orange "Install" or "Upgrade" button.
