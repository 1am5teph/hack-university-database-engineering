<h2>Why use a DB?</h2>
<ul>
<li>back in the day, we just used files</li>
<li>performance had to be tuned for every query</li>
<li>non-procedural queries are hard to write</li>
<li>had to change all code to modif record structure (abstraction)</li>
<li>no guarantee of atomicity (updates are all or nothing)</li>
<li>no guarantee of consistency (a bad query doesn't destroy the file)</li>
<li>no guarantee of isolation (you can imagine that you're the only user)</li>
<li>no guarantee of durability (your committed changes won't be lost)</li>
<li>hard to combine data</li>
<li>no language standards</li>
</ul>
DBs fixed all of those things.
<div>DBs typically use a client/server paradigm.</div>
<div>There are alternate versions of DBs/file servers.  We'll discuss some later</div>

<h2>DB Server</h2>
<div>Most SQL is executed on the DB server, bringing the instructions to the data, which is often what we need.</div>
<div>Communication protocols can be configured, which means you have to ask the admin what was done.</div>


<h2>DB vs OS accounts</h2>
You can have accounts on both host and guest and at the OS level, the DB level, and/or the client level.  In addition, you can run applications at on both the host OS and the client OS.  Make sure the understand the diagram below.

<h2>Setup DB user for vagrant OS account</h2>
These commands, executed on the guest OS will set you up to be able to connect to the DB as vagrant.
<pre>
sudo su postgres
psql
CREATE USER vagrant with CREATEUSER;
CREATE database vagrant;
\q
exit
</pre>
There are shell commands that do some of this, but we're focusing on SQL commands

<h2>Load Crime Data</h2>
Soon, we'll need some data loaded into our DB.  This command, executed as vagrant on the guest OS, will load some data for us.
<pre>
psql < buildCrimeDataRaw.sql
</pre>

<div>The original data came from http://civicapps.org/datasets/crime-incidents</div>

<h2>Structured data v unstructured data</h2>
A book is a classic example of unstructured data, where it's a stream of consiousness from the first page to the last.  However, whether or not data is structured depends on scale.  A book is unstructured on its own, but structured in a library.  A varchar is unstructured on its own, but structured in a record.
