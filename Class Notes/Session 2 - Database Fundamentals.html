<h2>Why use a DB?</h2>
<ul>
<li>back in the day, we just used files</li>
<li>performance had to be tuned for every query</li>
<li>Procedural queries can be hard to write</li>
<li>had to change all code to modify record structure (abstraction)</li>
<li>no guarantee that a bad query won't destory the file (consistency)</li>
<li>no guarantee that your committed changes won't be lost (durability)</li>
<li>no guarantee that your query won't stop after debiting your account but before crediting the second account in a transaction (atomicity)</li>
<li>no guarantee that someone else's code won't run at the same time as yours and cause yours to break (isolation)</li>
<li>hard to combine data</li>
<li>no language standards</li>
</ul>
DBs fixed all of those things.
<div>DBs typically use a client/server paradigm.</div>

<h2>DB Server</h2>
<div>Most SQL is executed on the DB server, bringing the instructions to the data, which is often what we need.</div>
<div>Communication protocols can be configured, which means you have to ask the admin what was done.</div>


<h2>DB vs OS accounts</h2>
You can have accounts on both host and guest and at the OS level, the DB level, and/or the client level.  In addition, you can run applications at on both the host OS and the client OS.  Make sure the understand the diagram below.

<h2>Our Virtual Server Configuration</h2>

Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>

<script>

var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.font = "20px arial";
ctx.textBaseline = "top";
ctx.rect(20, 20, 400, 400);//host OS rect
ctx.fillText('Host OS', 30, 30);
ctx.rect(30, 200, 380, 200);//guest OS rect
ctx.stroke();
ctx.fillText('Guest OS', 40, 210);
drawTube(ctx, 260, 220, 120, 100);//guest DB
ctx.fillText('Guest DB', 275, 270);
ctx.rect(80, 60, 140, 120);//host OS Client rect
ctx.stroke();
ctx.fillText('Host Client', 90, 110);
ctx.rect(80, 260, 140, 120);//guest OS Client rect
ctx.stroke();
ctx.fillText('Guest Client', 90, 310);

function drawTube(ctx, cx, cy, width, height)
{
   ellipseRadiusY = 10
   drawEllipse(ctx, cx, cy, width/2, ellipseRadiusY);
   ctx.save();
   ctx.beginPath();
   ctx.rect(cx, cy + height + ellipseRadiusY, width, ellipseRadiusY + 2);
   ctx.clip();
   drawEllipse(ctx, cx, cy+height, width/2, ellipseRadiusY);
   ctx.restore();
   ctx.beginPath();
   ctx.moveTo(cx, cy + ellipseRadiusY);
   ctx.lineTo(cx, cy + height + ellipseRadiusY);
   ctx.moveTo(cx + width, cy + ellipseRadiusY);
   ctx.lineTo(cx + width, cy + height + ellipseRadiusY);
   ctx.stroke();
}

function drawEllipse(ctx, cx, cy, rx, ry)
{
   ctx.save();
   ctx.beginPath();
   ctx.translate(cx, cy);
   ctx.scale(rx, ry);
   ctx.arc(1, 1, 1, 0, 2*Math.PI);
   ctx.restore();
   ctx.stroke();

<h2>Vagrantfile</h2>
All of the configuration information for your vagrant box is stored in Vagrantfile.  Look through it if you haven't.

<h2>Bash</h2>
There are a few bash commands that you should be familiar with during this class.  We'll learn more later.
<ul>
  <li>ls - list files in this directory</li>
  <li>cd - change directory</li>
  <li>cat - display a file</li>
  <li>head - display the first 10 rows of a file</li>
  <li>man - display the manual page on a command</li>
  <li>info - display info on a command</li>
  <li>less - break the input up into individual pages</li>
  <li>exit - close the current session</li>
  <li>sudo - give you a hall-pass for the operating system</li>
  <li>su - let you become someone else</li>

</ul>
You can redirect the output of bash commands using &gt;, &lt;, and |.  &gt; sends the output of a command to a file.  &lt; reads a file and sends it as the input to the command.  | takes the output of the first command and sends it as input into the second command.

<pre>
  ls &gt; file.txt
</pre>
The command above will list the contents of the current directory and store that information into file.txt (it won't actually be shown on the screen).

<pre>
  ls | less
</pre>
The command above will list the contents of the current directory broken up into pages to make it easier to read.

<pre>
  cat file | less
  less &lt; file
</pre>
Both the commands above do the same thing.

<p/>Last, if you follow a command with an &amp;, the command will be run in the background.

<h2>Install Database</h2>
We need to change our provision script to install postgres and pgadmin3
<pre>
  apt-cache search postgres
  apt-cache search pgadmin
</pre>
This command tells us what postgres and pgadmin programs are available to us.
Add install lines to our provision script and rebuild our vagrant box.
<pre>
  vagrant destroy
  vagrant up
</pre>

<h2>Setup DB user for vagrant OS account</h2>
These commands, executed on the guest OS will set you up to be able to connect to the DB as vagrant.
<pre>
  sudo su postgres
  psql
  CREATE USER vagrant with CREATEUSER;
  CREATE database vagrant;
  \q
  exit
</pre>
There are shell commands that do some of this, but we're focusing on SQL commands

<h2>Load Crime Data</h2>
Soon, we'll need some data loaded into our DB.  This command, executed as vagrant on the guest OS, will load some data for us.
<pre>
psql &lt; buildCrimeDataRaw.sql
</pre>

<div>The original data came from http://civicapps.org/datasets/crime-incidents</div>

<h2>Connect in pgAdmin</h2>
Execute this command.
<pre>
pgadmin3
</pre>
This launches pgAdmin.  Once the application launches, go to File-&gt;Add Server.  Put local in the name field and don't change any of the other values before clicking on OK.  With this configuration, you will probably need to enter your guest OS password each time you reconnect.

You can now browse the database instance in a graphic representation.  Try right-clicking on everything.  Open Server Groups-&gt;Servers-&gt;localhost-&gt;Databases-&gt;vagrant-&gt;schemas-&gt;public-&gt;tables.  You can now see the new table that we just created.
